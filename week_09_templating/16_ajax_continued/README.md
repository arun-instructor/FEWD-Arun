##Code-Along: Updating Records
- For this activity we will be building a simple form to update a specific wine.
- Here are the steps we will follow:
	- Step 1: Create a HTML form that is identical to the one for adding a new wine.
	- Step 2: Make a `GET` request to the URL for grabbing a member wine.
	- Step 3: Insert the data from the request into the "value" attributes of the form fields.
	- Step 4: Validate the form with Parsley.
	- Step 5: Perform a `PUT` request to the wine member URL with the form data.
- Be aware that since this API is live and we're a big class, you will likely all be overwriting each other's requests. If your stuff doesn't show up, try another wine to update.

##Reading for Next Class:
- Next class we will be covering JavaScript templating.
- Take a look at the [documentation for Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) and see if you can figure out how to use it.
- Also it would be a good idea to play around in the console with more JSON objects, as this will be a common theme.
